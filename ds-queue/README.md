## Data Structures - 20 minutes
  * [] Implement a queue class.
    * You can use an array for storage, **AND** delegate to its methods
    * Instances of your queue class should have a `.add ()` method
      * accepts any value as input, and adds it to private storage
    * Instances of your queue class should have a `.remove ()` method
      * returns the most recently added value that has not already been removed
    * [] The queue should have no methods or properties other than `.add` and `.remove`
      * You can test this by calling `Object.keys ()` on your queue instance
    * The queue should clean up references to values that it no longer needs.
