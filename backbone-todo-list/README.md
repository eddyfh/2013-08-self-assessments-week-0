## Backbone + CoffeeScript - 45 minutes

* Given a working Backbone view class that is backed by a collection of todo tasks, write a todo model and a todo collection that satisfies the interface expected by the view
* To compile your files: in terminal from within the `CoffeeScript_Backbone` directory, run `sh ./build.sh`.
  * This will compile the coffee files with source maps & watch them for changes. It might be wise to run this in another terminal window so you can still commit often.
  * Note: if you would like to enable source maps in the chrome console, click the gear to open the settings, then make sure `Source Maps` is checked. Source maps will show you line errors corresponding to your CoffeeScript files. This is an optional step to aid in debugging.
