## Sinatra
  * Given a skeleton Sinatra server tied to a local database, create a simple idea list app.
    * Serve down a basic `index.html` file with a text input and a list of previously submitted ideas below.
    * Users should be able to submit ideas that will be saved to the database.
    * Once saved, the list should be updated with the new idea.
