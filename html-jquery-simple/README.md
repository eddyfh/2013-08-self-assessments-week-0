## HTML/CSS basics

Create a simple HTML page with a jQuery click event.

- Should contain 2 different color DIVs that are floated side by side. (e.g. http://i.imgur.com/Wbtbv6j.png)
- Use jQuery to set up a click event that will change the background color of only the most recently clicked element.
  * If the the main body is clicked, all elements should change to their default background color.
  * *Note*: CSS page is not needed, you can simply add a `<style>` tag in the `<head>`
